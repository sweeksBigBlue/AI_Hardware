## Question 1:
**Please provide me a list of physical systems that solves differential equations inherently. I.E. the physical properties solve it, no traditional computing required.**

### Answer:

The following physical systems inherently solve differential equations through their natural behavior, without the use of traditional digital computing:

---

### 1. Mechanical Systems (Springs, Masses, Dampers)
- **Type:** Second-order ODEs  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F(t)
  \]

---

### 2. Electrical Circuits (RLC Circuits)
- **Type:** Linear/nonlinear ODEs  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  L\ddot{q} + R\dot{q} + \frac{1}{C}q = V(t)
  \]

---

### 3. Thermal Systems
- **Type:** Heat diffusion PDEs  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
  \]

---

### 4. Fluid Dynamics Systems
- **Type:** Navier-Stokes equations  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  \rho\left(\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla\vec{u}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2 \vec{u}
  \]

---

### 5. Soap Films / Minimal Surfaces
- **Type:** Laplace’s equation / minimal surface PDEs  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  \nabla^2 u = 0
  \]

---

### 6. Analog Computers (Op-Amps, Capacitors, etc.)
- **Type:** Configurable ODEs/PDEs  
- **Example:** Analog computing circuits can be built to simulate dynamical systems.

---

### 7. Wave Propagation (Strings, Membranes)
- **Type:** Wave equation  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
  \]

---

### 8. Quantum Systems
- **Type:** Schrödinger equation (PDEs)  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\psi
  \]

---

### 9. Optical Systems (Lenses, Mirrors, Interferometers)
- **Type:** Helmholtz, paraxial wave equations  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  \nabla^2 E + k^2 E = 0
  \]

---

### 10. Elastic Materials
- **Type:** Elasticity PDEs (e.g., Navier-Cauchy)  
- **Example Equation:**  
  \[
  \mu \nabla^2 \vec{u} + (\lambda + \mu) \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{u}) = \rho \frac{\partial^2 \vec{u}}{\partial t^2}
  \]
