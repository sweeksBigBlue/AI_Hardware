# AI_Hardware
GitHub repository for AI Hardware at PSU ECE 510

## Directory layout
`code/` Contains all code fest and weekly challenges code. Specifically, code fest code that does not relate to the final project or is tertiary.

`doc/` Contains all documents for relavent texts on communication with my LLM, needed documentation, papers for the project, or animations.

`proj/` Contains all relevant code to the final project!

## Stephens HW AI blog
[Here](https://github.com/sweeksBigBlue/AI_Hardware/wiki/Stephen-Weeks-AI-HW-Blog!) you can find my blog Challenge blogs!
This covers all of the weekly challenges including a running blog of my project. This is helpful because
our code fest challenges specifically deal with the project. So seeing how code related that week is helpful
to understand how the code changes interact!

Forthe project you can go to this [link](https://github.com/sweeksBigBlue/AI_Hardware/wiki/HW-AI-Blog-Project) to see how project methodologies are going).

## NeRF
I am basing my project on the Nerual Radiance Fields (NeRF) methodology where the paper is seen [here](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf).

The attempt of this project is to make it more available to academic and education purposes with edge devices so I'm targetting acceptable speed for something
like an occulus while maintaining acceptable power and data integrity. NeRF allows us to reconstructor multiple sided 2D images into a 3D image that can be
rotated and expanded and what presented in 2020 by Google researchers. This could open major possibilities in visualization education in chemstry, mathematics,
physics, history, and other subjects where visual information can help improve understanding. My goal is to use an analog simulation results to prove out the
possibility of an analog solution for a NeRF DSP acceleration chiplet.
