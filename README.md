## Directory layout
`code/` Contains all code fest and weekly challenges code. Specifically, code fest code that does not relate to the final project or is tertiary.

`doc/` Contains all documents for relavent texts on communication with my LLM, needed documentation, papers for the project, or animations.

`proj/` Contains all relevant code to the final project!

## Stephens HW AI blog
[Here](https://github.com/sweeksBigBlue/AI_Hardware/wiki/Stephen-Weeks-AI-HW-Blog!) you can find my blog!
This covers all of the weekly challenges including a running blog of my project. This is helpful because
our code fest challenges specifically deal with the project. So seeing how code related that week is helpful
to understand how the code changes interact!
