# Project

This is the project directory. Final analysis reports can be found in the root of this directory.

This directory is split up into two sub directories: `sw` and `hw`.

The `sw` directory contains the final software simulations as well as a directory for failed attempt files
that did not work. Here you can run and analyze results similar to what was shown in the report. The report
did use a 2080 RTX Nvidia chipset for profiling using Pytorch so make sure that you have a GPU that can support
this framework. If not, your results may differ. Screenshots are provided for analysis within the directory.

The `hw` directory contains the final hardware project including python simulation scripts, LTSpice netlist,
LTSpice logs, and LTSpice exported text documentation. Make sure your LTSpice is configured in vanilla format
and check the quickstart guide at the root of this directory for setting up a `venv` for running your python
modules as needed. This directory also includes screenshots and graphs from the running simulations.
