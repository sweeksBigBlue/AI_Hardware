# Code

This contains all the weekly challenges that included necessary code to complete. Please make sure you have
read the quick start guide for setting up a `venv` and have the appropriate configurations setup. For the 
CUDA code please make sure you have a GPU configured to run this with proper tools. This can be found at the
CUDA website for NVIDIA on how to install these packages. Here you will find code, graphs, and screen grabs
that coincided with ECE 510 AI Hardware's weekly challenges.
